# Pharmaceutical-Data-Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a large dataset of pharmaceutical sales data to identify trends and patterns, and the development of an AR(1) model to forecast future sales. The model was trained on 67 months of data and evaluated on a test set of 3 months, achieving a root mean square error of 764.29.

Project Structure

Data: Contains the pharmaceutical sales dataset used for analysis and modeling.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and visualization code.
Models: Trained AR(1) model and associated model evaluation metrics.
Visualizations: Plots and visualizations of results, including trend analysis and forecasted sales.

Technical Details
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Extraction of relevant features from the dataset, including time series decomposition and lag features.
Model Selection: Evaluation and selection of the AR(1) model based on performance metrics, including RMSE and mean absolute error.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the trained model on a test set, including calculation of RMSE and visualization of results.

Getting Started
